# Hey there! 👋 I'm Wataru

Welcome! I'm a full-stack engineer who genuinely loves building products that make people's lives easier. Over the past decade+, I've been lucky enough to work on all sorts of projects—from mobile apps that fit in your pocket to cloud infrastructure that powers businesses behind the scenes.

What drives me? Creating experiences that just _work_ and feel great to use. I believe the best technology is the kind you don't have to think about—it simply does what you need it to do.
